# Mfga
MyFirstGeneticAlgorithm - A genetic program which uses a list compass points to act as a goal ie 'N', 'E', 'S', 'W', then using many iterations of random generation, genetic crossover, survival of the fittest and mutations attempting to reach that inital goal.

Where the output is in the format: {iteration count to reach goal, goal, {best genome in previous iteration, fitness of previous best}, seconds_elapsed}

# Configuration
Default values found in config.exs:

genome_length: 40,
genome_values: ~w(N E S W),
population_size: 10000,
mutation_chance: 0.1


The fitness is found by counting the number of correct values which are in the correct positions when compared to the goal genome.
Genome values are the possible values a gene in a genome can take.
The population size is the number of genomes in a population.
The mutation chance is the likelyhood that each child gene will randomly mutate.

Run tests using 'mix test'

# Possible Improvements
I created this algorithm before really knowing much about genetic algorithms or how they should work, I mainly used a [flow diagram](GA-flowdiagram.png) provided in my second lecture of my Computational Intellignce in Business, Economics and Finance module and I am quite happy with the results I achieved considering this.

After a few more lectures I can now see many improvements which I could make, such as:
  - I now know I should call an array of singular genes, ie ["N", "S", "W"] a chromosone.
  -My crossover function does not use randomness to produce the offspring, instead of using a random crossover point I always use the middle of the genome. On top of this, my function only produces one offspring instead of two.
  - I do not use fitness-proportionate selction, meaning my algorithm does not balance exploitation and exploration, this is due to the fact I simply take the top 50% of the fitness values when performing 'survival of the fittest' instead of giving all values a chance.
  - There was no probability to apply the crossover function.
